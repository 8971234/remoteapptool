This project has was made open-source on 29/9/2019.

I started this project in 2011 as an inexperienced developer playing with VB.NET. Over the years I have changed and improved the functionality, but the code remains awful.

I no longer have time to make regular updates, so please take it and improve upon it if you have the time and motivation.
